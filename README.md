# Live Google Charts for Laravel Livewire 3
Auto refresh/poll charts.


## Live?
**Live** as in the charts will auto refresh at a specified poll interval using the **Livewire wire:poll** attribute.

Note that the component is only drawn the first time and thereafter only the data is updated on every poll, so the data used for polling is significantly less and the chart is just **updated, not recreated** every time.

## Credit to Helvetitec
This package is an extension of the excellent [Helvetitec/lagoon-charts](https://github.com/Helvetitec/lagoon-charts) Google charts package by [Helvetitec](https://github.com/Helvetitec).  
Except these ones are "live" :-)

If you are only looking for static charts, just use their package because this one requires it anyway.

## Requirements

- Laravel 9+
- Livewire 3+

## Installation
```
composer require mvnrsa/livewire-live-google-charts
```

## Usage
You have to add `@lagoonScripts` and `@lagoonStyles` from the lagoon-charts package to the layouts that will have charts on them.
```
@lagoonStyles
```
```
@lagoonScripts('en')
@lagoonScripts({{ app()->getLocale() }})
```

## Obtaining the Data
The package uses a cached query builder to query the database and fetch the data.  Actually only the query, bindings and connection is cached because we can not cache the builder class(es) between requests.

You have to start by prepairing a builder that will fetch your data every time the data needs to be refreshed.

### Something like this:
```
$builder = Model::select('column',DB::raw("count(*) as cnt"))
                 ->groupBy('column')
                 ->orderBy('column');

$chartOptions = [ 'title'=>'Chart Title', 'builder'=>$builder, 'poll'=>2, 'width'=>500, height=>250 ];
```

### This builder will give you nice random data for testing:
```
$builder = Model::select( 'column',
                            DB::raw('FLOOR(1+rand()*10) AS `cnt 1`'),
                            DB::raw('FLOOR(1+rand()*10) AS `cnt 2`'),
                            // DB::raw('FLOOR(1+rand()*10) AS `cnt 3`'),
                            // etc.
                          )
                    ->orderBy('column')
                    ->groupBy('column');
```

## Configure the Chart
```
$chartOptions = [ 'title'=>'Chart Title', 'builder'=>$builder, 'poll'=>2, 'width'=>500, height=>250, /* ... */ ];
```
- title should be obvious
- builder is the builder instance (without `->get()`!)
- poll is in seconds
- width and height can be anything that HTML / Google charts will understand - px, %, em, etc.
- is3D (true/false) make some charts 3D
- colors provide a color pallette
- pieHole (0.0 to 1.0) controls the relative size of the pie hole for donut charts

## Blade
```
@livewire('livecharts-pie-chart', $chartOptions)
```

## Available charts
- Pie
- Donut
- Bar
- Column
- Line
- Area
- Candlestick

Just replace pie in the blade example above with donut, bar, column, etc.

Note that for a candlestick chart the builder should return 5 columns.

## Colors
You can specify the color pallete for the chart by adding a `colors` array to the options.  
Any color that will work in HTML will work eg:
```
$colors = ['red,'#00ff00','#0000ff','pink','cyan'];
$chartOptions = [ 'title'=>'Chart Title', 'builder'=>$builder, 'poll'=>2, 'colors'=>$colors ];
```

## Other Google Options
Any other options can be passed to the Google chart library by simply adding an `options` array to the chart options:
```
$chartOptions = [ .... 'options'=> [ /* other options here */ ] ];

```

### Coffee

One of my favorite escapes from coding and business is taking my wife for a **coffee** (which is pretty cheap in South Africa).

If you use this package please think about how much time and effort you saved and **[buy us a coffee â˜•](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mvnrsa)**.
